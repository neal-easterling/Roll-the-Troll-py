Python Edition
[JS Edition](https://apps4everyone.tech/apps/roll-the-troll/index.html)
I created this app in order to learn Python.  It was later converted to JS.

##Description
I wanted to create an old school text-based DnD dice game.  While it was mostly an exercise in learning a new coding language,
I created it with a nod to social emotional learning targets for high school students.  However, the references are purely 90's culture.

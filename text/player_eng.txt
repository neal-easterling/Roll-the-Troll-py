You’re a crook! You’re a cheat and a swindler! 
Why, you stuck up, half-witted, scruffy-looking Nerf herder. 
Take this quarter, go downtown, and have a rat gnaw that thing off your face! 
... cheap, lying, no-good, rotten, four-flushing, brainless,   
... hopeless, heartless, bug-eyed, stiff-legged,  
... spotty-lipped, worm-headed sack of monkey dung! 
Are you gonna bark all day little doggie? Or are you gonna bite? 
You are gonna need a bigger boat. 
This is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.

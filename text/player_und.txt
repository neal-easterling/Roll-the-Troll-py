I am not sure I understand.
Why is that?
Please explain it like I'm six.
OK, so you are probably going - Is this like a Noxzema commercial or what? 
But seriously, I actually have a way normal life for a teenage girl.
I do not get it. Did my hair get flat? 
Did I stumble into some bad lighting? What is wrong with me?
You mean to tell me that you argued your way from a C plus to an A minus?
